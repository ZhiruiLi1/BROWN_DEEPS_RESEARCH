All those graphs are generated using the graph_depth() function defined in the "STAC_Project.ipynb" file.

All those graphs represent the depth evolution for each cast number using an edited dataset but without deleting noisy observations (the dataset is preprocessed using the function getdata2()). We are only interested in scan intervals where depth increases constantly.
